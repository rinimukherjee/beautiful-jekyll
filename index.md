blabel is a software package for labelling blank nodes in RDF graphs in a canonical manner. The package will label blank nodes in a manner that preserves isomorphism and should be efficient for most real-world graphs. Options are provided to label blank nodes as blank nodes, or alternatively as IRIs, in the latter case effectively Skolemising them.

The new version of blabel (2016) also includes methods for leaning an RDF graph. This may be useful if you wish to remove some redundancy from the RDF graph before you label the blank nodes, thus going further than isomorphism, preserving the (simple) equivalence of RDF graphs: graphs that are not only structurally the same (isomorphism) but also say the same thing (equivalence) in terms of simple semantics.
